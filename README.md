Full-stack AI Chat Box
Technologies Used:
Frontend:
React: The frontend is built using React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface for real-time chat and interaction.
React Query: You’ve used React Query to handle data fetching, caching, synchronizing server state, and background updates. This ensures smooth communication with the backend and efficient data handling for chat features and image uploading.
Clerk: Authentication is managed using Clerk, enabling secure user registration and login, with multi-factor authentication, session management, and user profiles integrated into the system.
ImageKit: For image handling, you've integrated ImageKit to store, optimize, and manage images uploaded by users during conversations.
Backend:

Google Gemini API: This API powers the AI chatbot, providing conversational AI capabilities like understanding user queries, generating responses, and providing image-based interactions (if supported by Gemini).
Node.js and Express: The backend API is built with Node.js and Express, facilitating communication between the frontend and the AI chatbot. The backend handles user queries, processes data from the Google Gemini API, and manages requests for chat sessions.
Mongoose: Data models for chat history, users, and sessions are created and managed using Mongoose, allowing smooth integration with MongoDB for database operations.
MongoDB: As your database, MongoDB stores all relevant data, including chat logs, user profiles, and system metadata, with the ability to scale as the number of users grows.
Key Features:
Real-time AI Chat:

Users can chat with an AI-powered bot that responds to queries, providing text and potentially image-based answers.
The chat interface is fully dynamic, allowing users to ask questions, send media, and receive responses in real-time.
User Authentication:

Secure user authentication is powered by Clerk, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their sessions.
Clerk ensures multi-factor authentication, secure password management, and session persistence, offering users peace of mind when accessing their chat histories.
Image Upload and Processing:

Users can upload images directly within the chat to enhance their conversations. These images are processed and optimized using ImageKit, ensuring fast load times and efficient storage.
Images are stored securely and can be shared or accessed in chat history.
Data Fetching and State Management:

React Query is used to efficiently fetch chat data, ensuring that the user’s conversations are updated in real-time without unnecessary reloads. It caches responses and synchronizes states between server and client seamlessly.
Scalable and Secure Backend:

The Node.js backend handles requests for the AI model and manages chat sessions efficiently.
Google Gemini’s API is integrated for intelligent conversational responses and possibly image-related features.
The database is powered by MongoDB with Mongoose handling the object modeling, ensuring that the system is scalable and can handle large amounts of user data.
